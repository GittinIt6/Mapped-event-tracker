## Mapped Event Tracker
A map tracking natural events across the globe, with a search bar to look for events in specific places. The option to look for specific events and within date ranges is currently being added. 

## User Stories
As a concerned mother, I want to see if there are any natural events occurring around any of my family members, so that I can rest easy.
As a curious person, I want to see if that thing I just felt was actually an earthquake, so I can sate my curiousity.

## Usage
When loaded, a map will appear with a search bar, start by searching for a location you are interested in. Then adjust parameters from menu in top right for date range/ event types. In the bottom right is a help menu if needing to refresh on what the app can do.
